# score_chai
A chess AI which plays chess by scoring board positions.

Contains Tensorflow code to play chess games, and then apply either a reward or punishment
to the model if it won or lost. Over time, the model learns to score winning board positions
as better than losing ones, and is more likely to end up in those positions.
